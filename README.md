## Background

_Searching for new job positions I have faced a sad reality:
after almost **15** years working as Software Engineer specialized in
Frontend Development, many companies & recruiters drops your candidatures
because "you don't master X library"_.

_So I have decided to create this web application as kind of "portfolio" showcase_.

## Objective

I will try to create the same web application using different Frontend technologies, to know:

- [ ] [VueJS]()
- [ ] ReactJS
- [ ] Web Components
- [ ] ??

The application will be a consultative web application of the project https://swapi.dev,
a public backend API based on Star Wars ® fictional universe.
